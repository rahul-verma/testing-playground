## Equivalence Class Partitioning

For the following exercises:

1. Identify equivalence classes for the parameters(s) under consideration.
2. Design a minimal set of test cases for this configuration input.
3. In case there are multiple parameters, the test cases should cover each partition for each parameter atleast once.

### Exercise 1 (Integer) – Data Retention Configuration (Compliance)

#### Scenario

An admin configures the data retention period for call recordings in the customer care platform.

System rules:
- Retention period is configured as an integer number of days.
- Must be between 30 and 365 days inclusive.
- If the value is invalid, the system must reject the configuration and log an error.


### Exercise 2 (Decimal) – Refund Amount Input (Web Chat, Finance Rules)

#### Scenario

For returns & refunds, the customer enters a refund amount in web chat.
Business rules (for a given currency, say EUR):
- Amount must be > 0
- Maximum amount per refund is 10,000.00 EUR
- Support at most 2 decimal places
- Must be a valid number

### Exercise 3 (String) – Order ID Input (Chat)

#### Scenario

The AI agent supports order tracking via web chat.

The customer must provide an Order ID that has these rules:
- Exactly 12 characters
- Only uppercase letters A–Z and digits 0–9
- No spaces
- Must exist in the order system (but for this exercise, we focus only on input validation, not existence)

### Exercise 4 (Discreet) – Region-Based Policy Logic (EU vs US)

#### Scenario

An AI agent answers FAQ about coverage.
Rules:

- If customer country is in EU (including DE) → apply EU policy.
- If customer country is US → apply US policy.
- If country is outside EU and US → display “not yet supported”.
- If the country code is invalid or missing → ask customer to clarify country.
Input field: ISO country code as a 2-letter string (e.g. DE, FR, US).

### Exercise 5 (Output-based) - Intent Classification

#### Scenario

You are designing an AI assistant for an e-commerce site. Customers ask about their orders in natural language.

Your system must choose one of three response types:

1. TRACK_STATUS – Give tracking info / where it is / what’s happening
2. ASK_ETA – Tell them when it’s expected / confirm schedule
3. REPORT_ISSUE – Handle problems: delayed, missing, lost, no updates

Following are some NL prompts to think about:
1. Where is my package?
2. Can you tell me where my package is?
3. What's the status of my delivery?
4. Has my package been shipped yet?
5. Where's my order right now?
6. Can you track my package for me?
7. What’s going on with my shipment?
8. When will my package arrive?
9. Is my package out for delivery?
10. Do you know where my parcel is?
11. Where is my parcel currently?
12. What’s the current location of my package?
13. Can I get an update on my delivery?
14. What’s the tracking status of my order?
15. Has my order been dispatched?
16. Is my order on the way?
17. How far along is my shipment?
18. Where did my package get to?
19. Could you check the tracking for my order?
20. I’m trying to find my package—where is it?
21. My order hasn’t arrived yet, where is it?
22. Why is my package taking so long?
23. Can you see where my package is stuck?
24. Is there any update on my package?
25. Has my delivery been sent out?
26. Can you check if my package is in transit?
27. What’s happening with my order delivery?
28. Can you show me the tracking info for my package?
29. Where is my stuff?
30. Is my parcel still on its way?
31. How can I see where my package is?
32. Where exactly is my delivery right now?
33. What’s the latest tracking update for my package?
34. Did my package leave the warehouse yet?
35. Is my order already shipped?
36. Can you tell me if my package has been delivered?
37. Why hasn’t my package arrived yet?
38. Can you help me locate my package?
39. What’s the ETA for my delivery?
40. Can you give me the current status of my parcel?
41. I haven’t received my order—where is it now?
42. Is there tracking information for my order?
43. Where is my shipment at the moment?
44. Can you look up where my package is right now?
45. Has my package reached the local depot?
46. Is my parcel with the courier yet?
47. What does the tracking say about my package?
48. Where did my order end up?
49. Could you update me on where my package is?
50. Can you tell me where my order is currently located?


### Exercise 6 (Multi-var): Parcel Support Chatbot

You are testing a simplified parcel support chatbot that has two input fields:

- contact channel (three possible options: chat, email, phone)
- request type (three possible options: track status, ask delivery time, report problem)

For compliance reasons, customers are only allowed to report a problem over the phone.

If the user selects chat or email together with report problem, the form’s validation will block this combination.

Each test case consists of two input values: one contact channel and one request type.

What is the minimal number of test cases to achieve 100% EP coverage?

a) 4
b) 6
c) 3
d) 5

Select ONE option.
