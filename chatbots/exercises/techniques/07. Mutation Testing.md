## Mutation Testing

For this we use a reference Refund rules code and corresponding existing tests both written in Python.

1. Verify all existing tests pass: "python3 -m unittest discover -s tests". Make sure `test_approved_outside_refund_window_boundary_1` is commented out.
2. Execute `mutmut run`. It would create 60+ mutants. 
3. You'd notice that one of the mutants beings the following change:

Original:
```python
if (request_date - order.purchase_date).days > policy.max_refund_days:
    return Decision("DENIED", "Outside refund window")
```

Mutant:
```python
if (request_date - order.purchase_date).days >= policy.max_refund_days:
    return Decision("DENIED", "Outside refund window")
```

4. Uncomment the previously commented test, as it checks for a boundary condition that was otherwise missed.
5. Rerun `mutmut run` and you'd see that you've one less mutant to worry about. In the lingo of mutation testing, you "killed" a mutant.
