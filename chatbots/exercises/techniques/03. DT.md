## Decision Tables

For the following exercises:

1.  Identify the conditions and actions to create a decision table.
2. Look for opportunities for column reduction.


### Exercise 1

#### Scenario

The AI agent handles returns for physical and digital products.
Business rules:
1. Digital products
	- If the product has been used/downloaded, no refund.
	- If the product has not been used AND it is ≤ 30 days since purchase, full refund.
	- If > 30 days, no refund, regardless of use.
2. Physical products
	- If ≤ 30 days and unused, full refund.
	- If ≤ 30 days and used, store credit only.
	- If > 30 days, no refund.


### Exercise scenario: AI vs. human for risky actions

You are testing a Parloa-like AI customer service agent that decides whether to handle a request automatically or escalate to a human in a regulated financial/insurance environment.

For each incoming customer request, the decision logic uses four conditions:

- C1 – Authenticated?
Has the customer been successfully authenticated for this session?
Values: Y / N
- C2 – High-risk transaction?
Is the customer’s intent considered high-risk (e.g., large refund, policy cancellation, change of beneficiary)?
Values: Y / N
- C3 – High NLU confidence?
Is the NLU confidence above the configured threshold for this intent?
Values: Y / N
- C4 – Customer frustrated?
Sentiment analysis says the customer is frustrated/angry.
Values: Y / N

The system can take four actions (possibly more than one per rule):

- A1 – AI handles request fully.
- A2 – Ask the customer to authenticate first.
- A3 – Escalate to a human agent with context.
- A4 – Use an empathy/de-escalation message before any other action.

Business rules (high-level):

1. High-risk + not authenticated
- If the request is high-risk and the customer is not authenticated and the model is confident and the customer is calm, the AI should ask for authentication (A2).
- In all other high-risk + not authenticated combinations (low confidence and/or frustrated), the AI should apologize / de-escalate (A4) and escalate to a human (A3).

2. High-risk + authenticated
- If the request is high-risk, the customer is authenticated, confidence is high, and the customer is calm, the AI may handle the request itself (A1).
- If the request is high-risk and either confidence is low or the customer is frustrated, the AI should add empathy (A4) and escalate (A3).

3. Low-risk (non high-risk)
- If the request is not high-risk, confidence is high, and the customer is not frustrated, the AI should handle the request (A1).
- If the request is not high-risk, confidence is high, and the customer is frustrated, the AI should handle the request (A1) but add empathy (A4).

4. If the request is not high-risk and confidence is low, the AI should escalate (A3); if the customer is frustrated in these low-confidence cases, it should also add empathy (A4).
