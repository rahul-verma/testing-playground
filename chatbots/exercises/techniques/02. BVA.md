## Boundary Value Analysis

For the following exercises:

1.  Identify the logical boundaries in this rule set.
2. Propose a minimal BVA test set that exercises these boundaries.
3. For each test, state the expected outcome.

### Exercise 1 (Integer) – Data Retention Configuration (Compliance)

An admin configures the data retention period for call recordings in the Parloa-like platform.

System rules:
