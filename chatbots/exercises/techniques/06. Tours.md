## Exploratory Testing Exercise (Deep Dive): “Chatbot Tours in Orderland”

You have access to a **simple demo webchat chatbot** embedded in a web page. Check `casanova.py` in `demos` directory.

- It accepts free-text user input.
- Internally it maps each input to exactly one of **three intents**:
  - `TRACK_STATUS`
  - `ASK_ETA`
  - `REPORT_ISSUE`
- For each intent, the chatbot responds with a **stub/simulated answer**:
  - `TRACK_STATUS`: Pretends to look up an order and says something generic.
  - `ASK_ETA`: Pretends to calculate an ETA and gives a generic answer.
  - `REPORT_ISSUE`: Pretends to log an issue and acknowledges it.
- There is **no real backend**; everything is simulated.

Your mission in this exercise is **not** to check “if the stub works”, but to **explore how the chatbot behaves around those stubs**: how it classifies, how it handles weird inputs, how it supports (or fails) realistic conversations within those 3 intents.

We will use **exploratory testing tours** to structure our exploration.

### 1. Exercise Goal

By the end of this exercise, participants should be able to:

1. **Design and execute exploratory testing tours** tailored to a webchat chatbot.
2. **Reveal bug patterns** from the taxonomy, especially:
   - Intent misclassification,
   - Entity / phrasing issues,
   - Context & conversation flow issues,
   - UX / wording problems.
3. Capture **structured notes** that connect findings to:
   - SDLC stage where they were likely introduced,
   - Component(s) involved,
   - Follow-up test ideas or automation candidates.

---

### 2. Practical Constraints

- Timebox: **45 minutes** total.
- Group size: **2–4 testers per group** (if you have multiple groups).
- Each group has:
  - The webchat demo URL.
  - A simple note-taking template (see Section 6).
  - This exercise description.
- Each group explores one tour (25 mins), followed by debrief on interesting findings (~5 mins per group.)
---

### 3. High-Level Test Charter

> **Charter:** Explore how well the chatbot understands and handles user questions about order tracking, ETAs, and reporting issues via webchat, using focused tours to stress different bug patterns (intent classification, phrasing variability, conversation flow, and UX clarity), and identify at least 10 distinct observations (bugs, risks, or questions).

#### Success criteria:

- At least **10 distinct observations** collected, with:
  - 5+ clearly mapped to a **bug pattern category** (you don’t need to be perfect).
  - 2+ ideas for **follow-up automated tests**.
  - 2+ potential **requirements/design gaps** (things missing, not just broken).

---

### 4. Tours

You will perform **four tours**, each 10–15 minutes, plus time for note consolidation and debrief.

#### Tour 1 – “Intent Safari”

**Focus:** How the chatbot **recognizes the correct intent** (or fails to).

**Bug patterns to hunt for:**
- Intent misclassification
- Fallback/irrelevant responses
- Over-confident wrong mappings
- Ambiguous expressions

**Instructions:**

1. Create a list of **natural phrases** real users might use for each intent:

   - `TRACK_STATUS` examples:
     - “Where is my order?”
     - “Has my package shipped?”
     - “Can you check the status of order #12345?”
   - `ASK_ETA` examples:
     - “When will my order arrive?”
     - “What’s the ETA?”
     - “Is it coming today or tomorrow?”
   - `REPORT_ISSUE` examples:
     - “My package arrived damaged.”
     - “I got the wrong item.”
     - “I want to report a problem with my order.”

2. **Gradually distort** these phrases to test boundaries:
   - Add **politeness** and extra words: “Hey, sorry to bug you, but any idea when my order might show up?”
   - Add **typos / abbreviations**: “wen wil my pakage arive?”
   - Add **emojis**: “My parcel is late 😡 Where is it?”
   - Combine multiple intents: “My order is late and also the wrong color. Can I get a new one and when is it coming?”

3. For each input, note:
   - Which intent you **expected**.
   - What the **chatbot actually did** (if visible).
   - Whether the response **makes sense** for that intent.

4. Specifically try to create **ambiguous** cases:
   - “I haven’t received my order yet” (Could be `TRACK_STATUS` or `ASK_ETA`).
   - “My order is missing, what should I do?” (could be status, issue, or both).

**Deliverable from this tour:**

- A short table like:

  | Input phrase | Expected intent | Observed behavior | Interesting? (Y/N) | Notes / Bug pattern |
  |-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|

Try to find at least **5 interesting misbehaviors**.

---

#### Tour 2 – “Conversation Maze”

**Focus:** **Multi-turn conversation** behavior (even though responses are stubbed).

**Bug patterns to hunt for:**
- Context loss
- Dialogue loops
- Dead ends
- Incomplete fulfillment (from a user’s point of view)

**Instructions:**

1. Start conversations that **logically should require several turns**, even if the system is stubbed, for example:
   - “I want to check the status of my order.”
   - If the bot doesn’t ask for an order number, **pretend** and provide one: “It’s 12345.”
   - Continue as if you expect a real system: “Okay, and if I’m not at home when it comes, what happens?”

2. Try sequences such as:
   - `TRACK_STATUS` → follow-up `ASK_ETA` in the same conversation.
   - `ASK_ETA` → user expresses dissatisfaction → `REPORT_ISSUE`.
   - Start with small talk then move into an intent: “Hi, how are you? Anyway, my order…”.

3. See if the chatbot:
   - Keeps track of **what you just asked**.
   - Behaves consistently when you **refer back** to something:
     - “That one from last week.”
     - “The order we just talked about.”

4. Try **breaking the conversation**:
   - Long message, several questions in one.
   - Change topic mid-way (“Actually, forget tracking, the item is broken”).
   - Rephrase the same question multiple times in different ways.

**Deliverable from this tour:**

- A list of **3–5 conversation transcripts** where:
  - You label the **moment the bot seems to lose context or gets weird**.
  - Map those to bug patterns like “Context loss” or “Dead-end conversation”.

---

#### Tour 3 – “User Persona Costume Party”

**Focus:** How the chatbot behaves with **different user personas and emotional tones**.

**Bug patterns to hunt for:**
- Poor handling of emotional language.
- Vague or unhelpful responses.
- Hidden UX / wording problems.

**Instructions:**

1. Define at least **3 personas**:

   Example personas:
   - **Angry customer**: “My package is late AGAIN. This is ridiculous.”
   - **Anxious customer**: “I’m really worried, my medicine still hasn’t arrived.”
   - **Clueless new user**: “I don’t understand anything about orders, can you just help me?”

2. For each persona:
   - Start with **emotionally loaded** but still on-topic messages.
   - See if the chatbot:
     - Acknowledges the problem in a human way, or just responds generically.
     - Provides a **useful direction** (even as a stub).
     - Makes the user **feel heard** (subjectively).

3. Modify messages to be more extreme or more subtle:
   - Add ALL CAPS, exclamation marks, sarcasm, emojis, etc.
   - “Whatever, I guess you don’t care if my package is missing 🙄.”

4. Look for:
   - Responses that feel **tone-deaf** or **inappropriate**.
   - Situations where **small rewordings** change the intent mapping dramatically.

**Deliverable from this tour:**

- A short summary per persona:

  - What phrases you tried.
  - 2–3 interesting moments where the chatbot reacted poorly or surprisingly well.
  - Bug/risk tags: e.g. “Tone not aligned”, “Ambiguous mapping”, “Poor guidance”.

---

#### Tour 4 – “Edge-of-Reality Tour” (Glitches, Noise & Limits)

**Focus:** Edge cases in **input shape and length**, weirdness, and “breaking” the parser/intent mapping.

**Bug patterns to hunt for:**
- Entity / slot extraction issues
- Input modality handling issues
- Robustness problems

**Instructions:**

1. **Length & complexity:**
   - Very short inputs: “Status?”, “When?”
   - Very long rant: several sentences, multiple concerns.
   - Repeated characters: “myyy orrrderrr”.
   - Copy-pasted email or tracking notification text.

2. **Noise & off-topic:**
   - Add bits of unrelated talk: “By the way, your website is super slow, but anyway, where is my order?”
   - Joke or meme-like phrasing: “Yo bot, where’s my stuff at? 😅”

3. **Format weirdness:**
   - Include pseudo order numbers: “ABC-123-XYZ”.
   - Mix languages if applicable: “Where is meine Bestellung?”
   - Use symbols: “Order #12345?!??? Is it coming today?!”

4. Observe:
   - Does the chatbot still route to a sensible intent?
   - Does it fail in a consistent pattern (helpful for future automation)?
   - Does it get stuck or confuse itself?

**Deliverable from this tour:**

- A list of **“glitches”**: inputs that cause clearly weird behavior or misclassification, plus a ranked list of “top 3 weirdest failures”.

---

### 5. Mapping Findings to the Bug Patterns

After the tours, spend **15–20 minutes** consolidating:

1. For each interesting observation, try to map it to **a bug pattern** in conversation, integration, UX, etc.

   Example mapping:

   - “User writes ‘My order is late and also damaged’ → bot treats it only as ASK_ETA and never offers to log an issue.”
     - Likely pattern: **Intent Misclassification / multi-intent confusion**
     - SDLC stage: **Requirements / Design** (no multi-intent strategy), plus **Implementation** (classifier not trained/configured for multi-intent).
     - Component: **NLU, intent catalog, routing logic**

2. Identify any **gaps or new patterns** not covered before (e.g. purely UX-related).

3. Pick **2–3 findings** that:
   - Can be made a part of formal testing.
   - Would make sense to turn into **automated regression tests**.
   - Would require **requirements/design changes** rather than just a bug fix.
