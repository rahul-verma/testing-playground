- Fundamentals Create Pathways to Mastery.
Types of knowledge: Factual, Conceptual, Procedural, MetaCognition
- int i = 1;
	- Tech aspects.
	- See the unseen
	- What is user provided
	- What is intentional vs unintentional
	- If it is unintentional, how can you control it
	- If it is intentional, is it malicious? if not why did the user make a mistake.
	- Was the user able to provide the input at all? How easy was it for them?
- Quality
- Testing
- Monolith + Solve the Damn Problem (Think 1 person: Business/Dev/Tech)
	- Discuss basic concepts here as it makes the discussion simpler
	- Testing
	- Test Oracle, testing as a multi-var problem.
	- Quality Dimensions, how they conflict
	- Conflict within the quality dimentions
	- Interfaces and Testability (which is limited.)
	- User Perspective
	- Business vs Technology
	- Cost/Time vs Quality
	- PPT
	- High level task decomposition
	- Business contracts
	- How Would you test a light bulb?
- Monlolith + Prepare / Act
	- Better Task Decomposition. The first notion of Dev Cycle phases.
	- DDMs (Words like Planning/Analysis/Design start floating now.)
	- A clear realisation of Static vs Dynamic Testing.
	- Traceability (Basic Monitoring.)
	- More explicit Information Expansion
	- Ad-hoc Feedback Loop (biased.)
- Monolith + Prepare / Act (Separation Roles: Business/Dev/Test)
	- DDMs more formalised, less biased
	- Static Testing exercise
	- Other aspects
	- Multiple people - multiple machines. Machines: Prod/Dev/Test
	- More Monitoring & Control, Need for Quicker Feedback Loops
	- Risk: You spend more time on Prepare rather than Act.
- C1 + C2
	- Product Decomposition with component level as well as cross-component task decomposition.
	- What would you build first : Internal interfaces/contracts (tech contracts)
	- The first notion of contract
	- Test Doubles
	- One starts hearing about integration, API testing, Caller/Callee, Consumer/Provider etc.
- C1 to Cn
	- More granular Product Decomposition + Bigger Team
	- More granular task decomposition:	
		- Reqquirements vs Specs vs HLD vs LLD
		- Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Execution, Monitoring & Control.
	- Idea of environments rather than machines
	- Need for formalising processes
	- The notion of System as separate from a component
- S1 to Sn
	- The notion of system of systems (or sub-systems)

The only problem is it happens in reverse for most organisation.
SoS(U) -> SoS(T) -> S -> CI -> C 
C -> CI -> S -> SoS(T) -> SoS(U)

Which paves the path of products as we know them. Full of bugs.
